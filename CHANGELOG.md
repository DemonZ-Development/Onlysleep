## [1.2.0] - 2026-05-21

This release fixes critical bugs in the gradual and speed night-skip transition modes.

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **Fixed Gradual & Speed Skip Completing Instantly**:
  - Rewrote the time-advance logic in `SleepManager` using a distance-traveled approach that correctly handles the night→midnight→morning wrap-around. Previously, the completion check failed when `targetTime` was `0` (dawn) because `newTime >= 0` was always true on the very first tick, making both modes behave identically to instant skip.
- **Fixed "Good Morning" Message Appearing During Night**:
  - Restructured `skipNight()` to defer all completion effects (sounds, titles, broadcast messages, player cleanup, and boss bar removal) into a callback that only fires when the gradual/speed timer actually reaches the target morning time. Previously, these effects fired immediately when the skip was initiated, causing players to see the "Good Morning" message while it was still visually nighttime.
- **Speed vs Gradual Now Visually Distinct**:
  - With the fixed time-advance logic, speed mode (150 ticks/tick, ~2-3 second timelapse) and gradual mode (configurable, default 30 ticks/tick, ~6-8 second smooth transition) now produce genuinely different visual experiences as intended.

### 🛠️ Technical Improvements

- Gradual/speed timer tasks are now properly stored in `skipTasks`, allowing mid-transition cancellation if a player leaves the bed during the time-advance animation.

## [1.1.0] - 2026-05-21

This release brings massive stability, compatibility, and user-experience improvements to Onlysleep.

### 🚀 Key Improvements & Bug Fixes

- **100% Folia/Paper Multi-threaded Stability**:
  - Rewrote internal `SchedulerAdapter` to resolve reflection lookup issues and method signatures for Folia/Paper multi-threaded environments, preventing region-scheduler crashes.
  - Redesigned task self-cancellation on Folia to interact directly and safely with the region's returned `ScheduledTask` object via a thread-safe `AtomicReference` wrapper.
- **Fixed Operator Sleep Exclusion**:
  - Removed `onlysleep.exempt` from the default OP wildcard permission list in `plugin.yml`. Administrators and OPs now contribute to sleeping by default instead of being permanently exempt, resolving issues where OPs were unable to trigger night skip.
- **Enhanced Gradual & Speed Transition Modes**:
  - Resolved a critical bug in `gradual` mode where the skip task would continue running and fast-forwarding time all day.
  - Implemented the `"speed"` mode as a rapid timelapse fast-forward (150 ticks per tick) utilizing the self-canceling gradual skip engine.
- **PlaceholderAPI Null-Player Safety**:
  - Re-engineered `SleepPlaceholderExpansion` to process all player-independent placeholders first (e.g. `version`, `platform`, `percentage`, and all `world_` statistics), making it completely null-player safe when resolved from consoles, plugins, or non-player contexts.
- **Robust Player Trackers & Initialization**:
  - Fixed unique player count estimation in `OfflinePlayerTracker` by checking for first-time players (`!player.hasPlayedBefore()`), preventing `require-all-players-online` from bypassing offline check.
  - Integrated direct `PlayerJoinEvent` and `PlayerQuitEvent` hooks in the built-in `AfkTracker` to instantly initialize player activity on join and clean up on quit, solving a bug where silent/idle players could never become AFK.
- **Strict Bed-Enter Validation**:
  - Restructured `SleepListener` to only proceed with sleep registrations when `BedEnterResult` is explicitly `OK` (or custom-handled `NOT_SAFE`), avoiding false-positive skips caused by other failed bed enter attempts.
- **Asynchronous Recurring Update Checker**:
  - Automatically schedules asynchronous update checks every 4 hours (non-blocking) when automatic checking is enabled, rather than only checking once on startup.
- **Smart Configuration Updater**:
  - Implemented an automatic, stateful configuration merger that updates `config.yml` and `messages.yml` with new options and comments from the jar resources, fully preserving custom user values, comments, and formatting without overwriting user customization.
- **Safe Update Checks & Null-Safe Commands**:
  - Fixed unescaped brackets and double quotes in the Update Checker query parameters to comply with modern strict Java runtimes, preventing `URISyntaxException`.
  - Guaranteed null-safe execution of `/onlysleep update` by always instantiating `UpdateChecker` on plugin load, regardless of whether auto-checking is enabled in the config.

### 📝 Listings & Documentation (Java 21+)
- Fully updated server listings (`README.md`, `SPIGOT.md`, `HANGAR.md`, and `MODRINTH.md`) and the entire GitHub Wiki (`Home.md`, `FAQ.md`, `Installation.md`, `Commands-and-Permissions.md`) to reflect that Onlysleep requires **Java 21+** and clarify standard sleep permissions.
